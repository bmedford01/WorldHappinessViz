## Rough Breakdown of Tasks

* Created SQL database and loaded data. Joined the two datasets to include geo-coordinates. 
* Created HTML and CSS that displays a live dashboard page with multiple charts that pull from our dataset. 
* Created Leaflet map with markers and layers from the dataset. 
* Created interactive dropdown to select a country and display the "happiness factor" scores for the respective country in a bar chart next to the average across all countries. 
* Created scatter plots that display the "happiness factors" vs. the overall happiness score for each country. 
* Rendered this page using Heroku to https://ygroza.com
